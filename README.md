**Scientific Calculator using Java Programming**
This project is a simple scientific calculator developed using Java with object-oriented programming techniques.

**Features**
Simple Functions: Basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, power, and percentage. Trigonometric Functions: Sin, cos, tan, and their inverse functions. Exponential and Logarithmic Functions: Perform calculations involving exponentials and logarithms.

**Classes and Structure**
ScientificCalculator (Base Class): An abstract class defining the interface for all calculator functions. SimpleFunctions (Derived Class): Handles basic arithmetic operations. TrigFunctions (Derived Class): Handles trigonometric operations. ExponentialFunctions (Derived Class): Handles exponential and logarithmic calculations.

**How to Use**
Menu-Driven Interface: The calculator uses a text-based menu, where users can choose different operations. Input: Users can enter one or more values depending on the operation selected. Output: The calculation result is displayed after the operation is performed.

**How to Compile and Run**
To compile the program, use any Java Compiler.
